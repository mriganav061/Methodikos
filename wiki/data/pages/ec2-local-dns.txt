====== Local DNS/NTP Server ======
EC2 instances can be started and stopped on demand; we don't need to pay for stopped instances. But, **restarting an EC2 instance will change the IP address of the instance**, which makes it difficult to run HBase. We can resolve this issue by running a DNS server to provide a name service to all EC2 instances in our HBase cluster. We can update name records on the DNS server every time other EC2 instances are restarted.


===== Local Domain Name Server Config =====
  CONFIGURE BIND9
  We put all bind9 configuration files under conf/bind.
  To configure bind9 on Amazon EC2,
    - Replace your /etc/bind/named.conf.local and /etc/bind/named.conf.options with the same files under conf/bind.
    - Put zone files (db.hbase-admin-cookbook.com & db.10) under /var/lib/bind
    - Generate your secret key
      $ dnssec-keygen -a HMAC-MD5 -b 512 -n USER your.domain.com.
      this will create two files like this:
        Kuser.hbase-admin-cookbook.com.+157+44141.key
        Kuser.hbase-admin-cookbook.com.+157+44141.private
      Replace secret key of named.conf.local to the content of generated private key.
    - Change domain name to your domain name for all the configuration files
    - Change IP of DNS server to your server address
    - Change forwarder address to address of DNS of your EC2 region
    - Restart bind9 by typing /etc/init.d/bind9 restart
      You must increment the serial number every time you make changes to the zone file.

===== NTP Config =====
  CONFIGURE NTP
  We put all NTP configuration files under conf/ntp.
  To configure NTP server on Amazon EC2
    - Use ntp.conf.server as template
    - Replace NTP servers to public NTP servers of your location
    - Put ntp.conf.server as /etc/ntp.conf
    - Restart ntp daemon
      /etc/init.d/ntp restart

  To configure NTP client on Amazon EC2
    - Use ntp.conf.client as template
    - Replace server setting to IP address of your NTP server
    - Replace restrict setting to IP address of your NTP server
    - Put ntp.conf.client as /etc/ntp.conf
    - Restart ntp daemon
      /etc/init.d/ntp restart
      
===== What needs to be done with new instance =====
  - NTP client setup and setting NTP server IP on netp.conf.client
  - DNS setup
    - /root/bin contains following shell script.
    - https://github.com/uprush/hac-book/blob/master/1-setting-up-hbase-cluster/script/ec2-hostname.sh
    - /root/etc contains dnskey
  - Master needs to register openssh formatted private key for passphrase-less ssh communication with slaves.
  - /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf 


===== What needs to be done when all instances are restarted =====
==== NTP/DNS Server ====
  - Change dns ns1 server ip at /var/lib/bind/db.pmp-hbase.com
  - Restart bind9 service after all changes are made at dns clients in the cluster.
==== All other ====
  - Change dns ip at /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf
  - Change dns ip at /root/bin/ec2-hostname.sh
  - Change ntp server ip at /etc/ntp.conf
  - sync time: ntpudpate -d 'server ip'
  - check time: ntpq -p
  - restart or execute: sh ec2-hostname.sh
