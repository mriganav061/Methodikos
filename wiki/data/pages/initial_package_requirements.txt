The initial commercial launch will include three infrastructure types:
  *  Bridges
  *  Pavement
  *  Bike Paths & Sidewalks

Tiered packages will be offered to the client: Deer (light), Seal (medium), and Bear (heavy duty).  The requirements for these packages are illustrated in Table 1. The prototype development will focus on the Deer Package for pavements only.
