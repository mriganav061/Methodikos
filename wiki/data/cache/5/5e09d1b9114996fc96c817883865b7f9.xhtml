<p>
This page is intended to describe business operations that will be used in Methodikos to enlighten designing domain model that is suitable for efficient MapReduce programming model. Some of these operations are taken from txpave project and sub-operations are listed by inspecting the code and Paul&#039;s thesis.

The road network sections are preliminarily grouped at this stage. Each group contains a set of sections that belong to same highway id and that is continuos (meaning neighboring sections are connected as they are sharing same intersection point) and same pavement type. <a href="/wiki/doku.php?id=segmentation-pre-grouping-code" class="wikilink1" title="segmentation-pre-grouping-code">Code</a>

The main segmentation is performed by using three evaluation metrics named ESAL, Distress Score, and Condition Score. The CS, DS threshold values for segmentation are inputted from the user.

Once we have three segmentation results from each evaluation metric, these results will be stitched to one final segmentation result. For stitching process, the following priority is applied since there will be boundary conflict between any two.
