=== What's it all about?
Did you ever run into the annoyance that you have to upload a screenshot (or
any image from the local clipboard) to a website? 
Usually you go through the hassle of pasting the image into an image editor
(or worse: WinWord), save the image and upload this file.

Now imagine, you could save all those steps and paste the image directly from
the clipboard into the browser.
That's what Supa - the Screenshot UPload Applet - is all about.
